      <p> Bread will always bring me so much joy no matter what. I love every type and presentation of bread.
        It is truly a comfort food and something that is attached to many memories and good feelings. 
        When I was younger I used to visit my grandparents in Mexico with my family every four years or so.
        We would often go for about a month and we would stay a week or two in each of my grandparents houses.
        My mom comes from Mexico City, and staying with her side of the family was fun because it was all about
        exploring the city she grew up in. My grandfather would wake up every morning around six or seven and
        walk for about a mile or two and buy freshly baked bread and orange juice from the local vendors.
        This was part of his daily morning routine to the point where everyone along the walk knew him
        and greeted him. I wanted to experience this with him so I would try my absolute hardest to wake up 
        early so that I could join him on those walks. Sometimes I was able to join him, and sometimes my 
        sleep would win over me. But when I did persevere and go with him I loved every part of it.
        It was always such a pleasant and joyful experience to be part of his daily morning routine
        and get to meet the local vendors. Conchas are a commonly known Mexican sweet bread and I have deep
        rooted memories of home, comfort, love and security linked with them.
