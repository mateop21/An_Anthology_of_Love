<p>An image of my wonderful and energetic dog. My family decided to adopt a dog about five years ago during a cold February Winter. Nothing could prepare us for the journey we were about to embark on. Hope has helped bring my family together in a moment when it felt like everyone was going on their own paths. She has taught us to be more loving and delicate. Hope has comforted us by simply being herself.</p>

Love means never giving up. Love is an adaptable language with no boundries. Love is comforting.
