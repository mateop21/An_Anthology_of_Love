                Throughout the past year I have placed an emphasis on documenting and keeping track of
                my ideas and moments that happen in my life. It can be very simple as a word, letter or color
                that has captured my attention and made me think of another idea, or even sparked creativity in me.
                It can also be a conversation between friends or strangers. It can be the name of an artist
                or a piece of work that I want to review. It can also just be phrases that help me keep going.
                Sometimes it can just be reminders for the day such as to pick up eggs before going home or
                anything else. No matter how random or insignificant it may be, it is a documentation and
                reflection of who I am as a person in that moment in time. Sometimes it helps to look
                back and see what I was thinking or what was going on in my life.
