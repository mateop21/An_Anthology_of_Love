Throughout the past year I have placed an emphasis on documenting and keeping track <br>of
my ideas and moments that happen in my life. It can be very simple as a word, letter <br> or color
that has captured my attention and made me think of another idea, or even sparked <br> creativity in me.
It can also be a conversation between friends or strangers. It can be the <br> name of an artist
or a piece of work that I want to review. It can also just be phrases that help <br> me keep going.
Sometimes it can just be reminders for the day such as to pick up eggs before <br> going home or 
anything else. No matter how random or insignificant it may be, it is a <br> documentation and 
reflection of who I am as a person in that moment in time. Sometimes it <br> helps to look
back and see what I was thinking or what was going on in my life.
