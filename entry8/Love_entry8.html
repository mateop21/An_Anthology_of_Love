                Back at home during cold winters and heavy blizzards
                my sister and I would always anticipate the arrival of 
                snow. A lot of snow. Before going out as we would suit 
                up to go outside our imagination would run wild with
                the countless stories of what the outside world could
                bring. I loved putting on my snow boots and all my other
                "tactical" equipment and pretend I was Han Solo about to
                go on a search in Hoth. My sister and I would gather
                the icicles around my house and pretend they were precious 
                crystals. In addition I always loved the idea of building 
                an inhabitable space for us and our icicles. As my sister 
                 would go searching for the perfect icicles, I would spend  
                hours building the perfect igloo. Sometimes this activity 
                would take us days. We would wait for the icicles to grow
                and for more snow to fall to help build on our igloo 
                foundations. After a long day of working on our 
                "research and exploration" we would go back home just 
                before it got dark and we would drink hot chocolate. 
                These are a few of countless of fond memories I have
                with my sister.
