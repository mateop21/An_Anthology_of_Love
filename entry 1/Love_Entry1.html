<h1>Lavenders</h1>
<p>A gift my mom gave me when I returned home this summer</p>
<hr>

<br>
<p>Every summer break I would help my mom clean up and take care of our backyard. About five summers ago we planted a few lavenders in front of our house. Every winter they're covered by snow and every spring they come back to bloom.</p>

A core memory of my home
