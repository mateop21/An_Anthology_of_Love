        Batman is the greatest superhero of all time. <br>
        He is the embodiment of the human spirit. <br>
        He has no powers yet he is still able to fight <br>
        even the most powerful heroes and villains. <br>
        No matter what happens, Batman never gives up,<br>
        everytime he gets knocked down, he always gets<br>
        back up. Batman has always been my favorite hero <br>
        as I have vivid memories of looking at Batman <br>
        comic books even before I learned how to read. <br>
        For me Batman brings me peace and helps me connect<br>
        to a younger version of me as well as help bring me <br>
        direction of what I'm doing.

                This is one of my all time favorite Batman graphic novels.
                It successfully tells a story of a young struggling Batman
                and his journey to fight crime while at the same time being 
                totally new to everything. Batman doesn't have any special
                gadgets or cool tricks in here. He struggles staying afloat 
                but his heart is in a good place. We see Batman at his purest 
                human form as he is deliberately putting himself at risk for
                random citizens in Gotham. It also explores the character of
                Commisioner Gordon, as in this story he is completely new to 
                Gotham City and he isn't commisioner yet. This story does a well
                job of exploring every character and their own humanity.

               This is another really good Batman story that takes place 
               throughout an entire year. In this story, Batman is more
               experienced, he has multiple enemies as well as allies
               and he knows how to use every single character to his advantange.
               The Long Halloween explores a new enemy that Batman is facing
               which happens to be a serial killer that is after members of
               the mob. We also get to see some of Batman's most iconic enemies
               such The Joker, Catwoman, Scarecrow, The Riddler and more. This
               graphic novel does a good job of taking its pace and has multiple 
               plot twists. The reader is given a chance to go through this case 
               step by step with everyone else in the story and it fully 
               brings you in the role of a detective.
